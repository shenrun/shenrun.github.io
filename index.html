				Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
				And sorry I could not travel both<br>
				And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
				And looked down one as far as I could<br>
				To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
				<br>
				Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
				And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
				Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
				Though as for that the passing there<br>
				Had worn them really about the same,<br>
				<br>
				And both that morning equally lay<br>
				In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
				Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
				Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
				I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
				<br>
				I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
				Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
				Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
				I took the one less traveled by,<br>
				And that has made all the difference.<br></span>

<!-- 				Be yourself.<br>
				Especially, do not feign affection.<br>
				Neither be cynical about love;<br>
				for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment<br>
				it is as perennial as the grass. <br>
				<br>
				Take kindly the counsel of the years,<br>
				gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br>
				Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.<br>
				But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.<br>
				Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br>
				Beyond a wholesome discipline,<br>
				be gentle with yourself. <br>
				<br>
				You are a child of the universe,<br>
				no less than the trees and the stars;<br>
				you have a right to be here.<br>
				And whether or not it is clear to you,<br>
				no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. <br>
				<br>
				Therefore be at peace with God,<br>
				whatever you conceive Him to be,<br>
				and whatever your labors and aspirations,<br>
				in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. <br>
				<br>
				With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,<br>
				it is still a beautiful world.<br>
				Be cheerful.<br>
				Strive to be happy. <br>
				<br>
				Max Ehrmann, Desiderata, 1952.<br> -->
